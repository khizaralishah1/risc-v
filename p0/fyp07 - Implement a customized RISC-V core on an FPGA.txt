Title: Implement a customized RISC-V core on an FPGA.

Outcomes:
- Good understanding of Computer Architecture in general and RISC-V in particular
- Implementation skills using Verilog
- Using FPGAs to design and test digital logic
- Readiness for the embedded systems job market.

Background:
RISC-V is a relatively new processor ISA gaining huge popularity. Due to the proprietary
nature of the dominant ISAs, more and more companies are turning to the free and open
source RISC-V ISA to make their own cores. This has recently created a huge demand for
RISC-V design and validation engineers in the market.

Description:
This includes implement a 5-stage RISC-V pipelined processor and burn that design on an
FPGA. A couple of custom instructions can be added to explore ISA modifications.

Methodology:
One possible approach to implementing the project can be the following roadmap:
- Revision/Introduction to Verilog HDL
- Learn RISC-V assembly language
- Design and test a single-cycle RISC-V core in simulator
- Design and test a single-cycle RISC-V core on FPGA
- Design and test a pipelined RISC-V core in simulator
- Design and test a pipelined RISC-V core on FPGA
- Add custom instructions to the implemented RISC-V core.

Will be helpful if you have:
Courses like Fundamentals of Logic Design, Computer Organization and Assembly Language, etc.
Some familiarity with Verilog HDL
Interest in low-level hardware design.
